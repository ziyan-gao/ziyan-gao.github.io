## CoppeliaSim Robotic Simulator Teaching Experience

I have developed comprehensive teaching materials for CoppeliaSim, a professional robotic simulator used for research and education in robotics and automation.

### Course Content

The teaching materials cover:
- **Introduction to CoppeliaSim**: Interface, basic concepts, and workflow
- **Robot Modeling**: Creating and configuring robotic systems
- **Simulation Setup**: Environment configuration and physics engines
- **Programming & Scripting**: Lua and Python scripting for robot control
- **Sensor Simulation**: Vision sensors, distance sensors, and other robotic sensors
- **Non-prehensile Manipulation**: Pushing, grasping, and object manipulation simulations
- **Advanced Topics**: Motion planning, trajectory control, and multi-robot systems
