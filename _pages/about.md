## About Me

I am a Research Assistant Professor at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), specializing in robotic manipulation. My research focuses on developing and robust algorithms for solving practical planning problems.

## Research Interests

My current research interests include:

- **Robot Grasping and Manipulation**: Developing methods for robust object grasping in high-clutter and unstructured scenarios
- **Vision-based Robotic Control**: Using visual feedback to guide robotic manipulation tasks
- **Machine Learning for Robotics**: Applying deep learning and neural networks to improve robotic perception and decision-making
- **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating multiple sensory modalities for more effective robot control

I am particularly interested in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with applications to real-world robotic systems. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advances in AI and practical robotic applications.

## Specialized Research Fields

**Non-prehensile Manipulation**
- Analytical and data-driven analysis of the under-actuated pusher-slider system

**Object Physical Parameter Estimation**
- Estimation of physical parameters for novel objects based on robot-object interaction

**Data-driven Robotic Grasping**
- Deep neural network training based on large-scale simulation data for robotic grasping

**Robotic Bin Packing**
- Heuristic integrated effective online bin packing using deep reinforcement learning
