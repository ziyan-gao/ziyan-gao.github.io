## About Me

I am a Research Assistant Professor at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), specializing in robotic manipulation. My research focuses on developing and robust algorithms for solving practical planning problems.

## Research Interests

My current research interests include:

- **Robot Grasping and Manipulation**: Developing methods for robust object grasping in high-clutter and unstructured scenarios
- **Vision-based Robotic Control**: Using visual feedback to guide robotic manipulation tasks
- **Machine Learning for Robotics**: Applying deep learning and neural networks to improve robotic perception and decision-making
- **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating multiple sensory modalities for more effective robot control
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Studying security vulnerabilities in robotic systems and developing defenses against attacks

I am particularly interested in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with applications to real-world robotic systems. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advances in AI and practical robotic applications.

## Research Areas

- Object manipulation in high-clutter environments
- Few-shot learning for robotic grasping
- Vision-guided robot control
- Deep learning for robotic perception
- Security and robustness of robotic systems
