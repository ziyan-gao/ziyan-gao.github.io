## Teaching Experience

**Teaching Assistant (2023 – 2024)**  
Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Tokyo Campus)

During the 2023 Term 2-2 and 2024 academic terms, I served as a teaching assistant for a robotics class led by Professor Nak Young Chong. My responsibilities included:

- Helping students grasp fundamental simulation concepts using CoppeliaSim
- Guiding students on writing effective code and completing term projects
- Providing comprehensive introduction to CoppeliaSim and its frequently utilized functionalities
- Using simple diagrams to clarify challenging concepts (e.g., "object handles")
- Demonstrating implementation of key algorithms in CoppeliaSim to reinforce essential concepts
- Presenting various sample projects to illustrate the term project completion process

**Teaching Philosophy:**
I emphasize simplifying concepts by avoiding unnecessary complex terminology. For intricate algorithms, I provide well-commented code examples to enhance student comprehension and facilitate learning.
