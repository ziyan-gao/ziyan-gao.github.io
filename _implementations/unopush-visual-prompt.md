## Overview

This is an implementation of the work published in IEEE Xplore (Document ID: 10802843):
[UNO Push: Unified Nonprehensile Object Pushing via Non-Parametric Estimation and Model Predictive Control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10802843)

This implementation demonstrates unified nonprehensile object pushing techniques using non-parametric estimation and model predictive control for robotic manipulation. The system enables the robot to manipulate objects through pushing actions.

## Demo
