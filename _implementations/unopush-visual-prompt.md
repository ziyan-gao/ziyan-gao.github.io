## Overview

This is an implementation of the work published in IEEE Xplore (Document ID: 10802843):
[Visual Prompt Guided Pushing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10802843)

This implementation demonstrates visual prompt guided pushing techniques for robotic object manipulation. The system uses visual prompts to guide the robot in manipulating objects through pushing control.

## Demo
