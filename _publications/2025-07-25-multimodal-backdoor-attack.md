## Overview

This work introduces SEMBA (Shortcut-Enhanced Multimodal Backdoor Attack), a novel backdoor attack method designed for multimodal vision-guided robot grasping systems in high-clutter scenarios. The method leverages Multimodal Shortcut Searching Algorithm and Multimodal Trigger Generation to effectively compromise robotic grasping systems.
