## Overview

This work proposes a unified pushing policy that incorporates a lightweight prompting mechanism into a flow matching policy to guide the generation of reactive, multimodal pushing actions. The visual prompt can be specified by a high-level planner, enabling the reuse of the pushing policy across a wide range of planning problems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on multi-step push plans composed of pre-defined pushing primitives with limited application scopes, this method provides greater efficiency and versatility.

## Key Contributions

- **Unified Pushing Policy**: A flexible framework that can adapt to different pushing scenarios through visual prompting
- **Lightweight Prompting Mechanism**: Enables high-level planners to guide low-level pushing actions
- **Flow Matching Integration**: Uses flow matching policies to generate reactive, multimodal pushing behaviors
- **VLM-guided Planning**: Demonstrates integration with Vision Language Model-based planning for table-cleaning tasks
